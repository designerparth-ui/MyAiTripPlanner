# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev and build performance. To add it, see this documentation:
https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
